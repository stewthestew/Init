# Init
A very simple program to initialize a new project.


## TODO
- [x] Split the cli logic into its own file
- [ ] Use pflag instead of if-else everywhere
- [ ] Switch from Json to another language, possibly Toml or Lua (I made up my mind it will be Toml)
- [ ] Add shellhooks
- [ ] Add a way to split config files into multiple files
